# Task Manager 
Simple task manager library that manages asynchronous task wth some amount of flexibility.

# Build
Open the project in Visual Studio 2019, choose the Platform and Configuration and hit Build.

The output goes to `bin/{Platform}/{Configuration}/` and it will contain two directories:
- include\: Contains all __header__ files
- lib\: Contains the __.lib__ file

## Caution
You should use ISO C++ 17 (or higher if available) to build this project. Thiis can be done by going to `Configuration Properties` -> `General` -> `C++ Language Standard` and set it to (at least) `ISO C++ 17 Standard (/std:c++17)`.

# Usage
The only 2 header files that should have most interest to you are `TaskManager.h` and `Scheduler.h`.
```c++
#include <TaskManager/TaskManager.h>
#include <TaskManager/Scheduler.h>
```

The first thing you must do when using this library is to initialize the scheduler and at the end shut it down.
```c++
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  TM::Scheduler::getInstance().initialize();
  // Do some work
  TM::Scheduler::getInstance().shutdown();
  return 0;
}
```
